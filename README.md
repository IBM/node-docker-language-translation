# Docker NodeJS Language Translation Example

This repository is an introduction to Docker, which is a runtime for containers. We will create a containerized Node.js application that provides a service to translate phrases from one language to another. The application uses the Watson [Language Translation service](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/language-translator/).

## Running the application

A complete step-by-step guide for running the application as a container can be found in our [OpenShift 101 workshop](https://ibm-developer.gitbook.io/openshift101/getting-started/docker).
